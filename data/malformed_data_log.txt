This unidentified airborn object had no tail of debris such as that of a meteor.  It was a bluish white like the light of a xenon strobe. It did not flash, rather it pulsed off like a strobe pulses on.  It looked like a &quot;plasma sphere&quot;.  I have no way to perceive it&apos;s distance nor it&apos;s size.  It was in excess of 2,000 feet away, as it passed behind trees which were at least that far away.  Interestingly, I mentioned this to two other people an hour or so later, and one of them had seen what he described as the same type thing seen at the same time I saw it, yet he was 25 miles East of my location.

What struck me as unusual was that there was no headlights or stoplights that a gravel combination would have had, and the pattern of lights shifted relative to my position. Owing to the fact that I had neither binoculars nor time, I did not stop my combination to more closely observe the phenmenon. On the return trip, the conditions were similar, but there were no lights, so any idea of a mining installation was out of the question."}

Enjoy the show, we also observed a few satilites.  We then saw a point of light that we at first believed to be a satelite.  However, it was traveling roughly SE to NW, a direction I haven&apos;t seen before.  The point of light was typical of a satelite:  about the size &amp; brightness of an average star, and moving in a straight line at a typical speed for a satelite.  Within 2&quot;, however, the light momentarily came to a complete stop, and reversed direction.  It then stopped again and began a series of rough circles, stoping for a few minutes after each completed circle.  My friends reported smaller points of light leaving and returning to the object at one point in time (I was watching an appoaching plane, which I thought might have been a reconisance flight from the near-by air force base).  After about a half dozen of these circular trajectories, the object remained motionless, and faded-out with the light of dawn.  We watched this object for about 30&quot;.  The sky was clear.  Its cirlcles were limited to probably no more than 5 degrees of distance.  We feel that a plane, helicopter, and weather balloon can be ruled out."}

Time from initial discovery to loss of visual contact was about 20 seconds. The object had a strange sort of movement that I think can best be described as a jerky, low frame rate film with maybe 1/30 second gaps between movements. The color shifted from gold to brown to orange. The overall effect was a muddy orange coloration. The objects direction was straight at first, almost like a satelite&apos;s but traveling at about 2 1/2 times faster across the sky than a satelite would normally be seen travelling.The object turned slightly south east for the last five seconds that it was seen. The object slightly dimmed after the small change in direction for about two seconds. It then turned SSE for no more than probably 1/4 second and instantly vanished completely. During the first five seconds or so, I was looking at the object with my naked eye. For the next maybe 15 seconds, I followed the object with my 15 x 70 astronomical binoculars. Visually the object looked like a dim but larger than Jupiter object with light intensity changing +/- by as much as 1/3. When seen through my binoculars, it had a totally different look. Through the binoculars the object looked like a giant autumn leaf flying through the air as though alive. Again, while seen through the binoculars, the object had a beatifully fluid although slow frame rate movement. I say fluid because the frame rate of the movements remained pretty consistent. I am a serious amateur astronomer and spend about 8 hrs a week observing.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded credible, and we believe he probably is an exceptional eyewitness.

Mine was, I thought the moon until I realized it was moving horizontally right at the tops of the trees very slowly. It moved from the left side of my property to in front (I lived on a hill in a very rural area of Georgia). Impossible to tell how close or how large it was. Couldn&apos;t have been far or I couldn&apos;t have seen it thru the trees. Was also about 9pm at night, clear night in November. I did call a UFO org and a very nice fellow came up from Atlanta to talk to me, he took notes but came to no conclusion. Didn&apos;t dare call the local cops since I could just guess their reaction. When the thing came around to the front I was so creeped out I went inside. I just didn&apos;t like the looks of it and I was isolated and alone there on the property. No neighbors within sight or hailing distance and 1000 acres of lumber company land to my right (where it was heading). Memory gets less trustworthy thru the years of course but I would guess it was about the size of a quarter held at arms length. What the rising moon would look like at any rate, pale, no flashing lights or sound at all. Updated information to above sighting report below:  It was in Banks county Georgia, I&apos;m about 50 miles above Atlanta.  I had gone out to bring the cats in, around 9:00 in November, clear as a bell outside and saw this thing thru the trees. I thought &apos;oh how lovely the moon is&apos; until I realized it was moving horizontally and not at all in the right place for the moon, I of course said something like &apos;oh s*&apos; and just stood there in total amazement and watched it very slowly circle my property from the left of my house to the front, across the pasture.. The trees were bare so I could see it clearly and it stayed right at basically the same level. You are right it was too big for a helicopter and a solid softly glowing object, no flashing lights no noise, So not a blimp and too close to the trees for that also.....I wracked my brain trying to come up with some sort of perfectly ordinary object and failed. Why is it they are so creepy? You mention that too. When it came around to the front of my house I went inside, I honestly felt I didn&apos;t want to be around if it got closer. I don&apos;t worry about airplanes and I wasn&apos;t nervous living out in the boonies by myself (humans would be my major worry there), but that thing made me nervous after that, about wandering around at night. On one hand though you want to see it again because you just can&apos;t believe its not something known, and perhaps the second time it might reveal itself. I enclose a picture of approximately where it was when I went inside, it was about to go into the trees to the right and I figured I would either lose sight of it or it would move toward me. In reviewing this picture it was probably more the size of a dime held at arms length rather than a quarter...at any rate MUCH too big to be a star....hmmm swamp gas maybe....but what the heck is swamp gas ;-)  Don&apos;t forget me if you get some ideas, and God Bless for taking those sightings. Its important to get them down and believe me it helps to discuss these weird things with someone else.I would like to thank this witness for her report, as i very much appreciate you sending it into me.

I figured they were flares until one moved upward. After about 10 minutes of observation, I pulled my truck over on an offramp and parked.At the place I pulled over, there was noone else, it was a small construction site with a large pile of dirt. I got my camera, a 35 MM auto everything deal, and exited the truck, watching the objects, I climbed to the top of the pile and proceeded to take pictures. they moved a little, blinking on and off, and moving 5 to 10 degrees toward or away (up and down) from each other.I ran out of film, after taking a full roll (I reloaded once) of 24 exposures and 6 exposures on the other roll, watched for 30 to 45 minutes, then, pursuant to my schedul, I took off. I could see them almost all the way to AZ.Unfortunately, The film did not turn out, as Walmart&apos;s photo dept is incompetent, however, I still have the negatives, as well as a small notebook with specific date and times from my first noting them, until I lost them in light pollution, but they are somewhere in the chaos I have in my house since I moved.The weather that night was extremely clear, no clouds.I was wide awake, having just awaken in California, and started driving 3 hours before.1) The strange things were that, even though I pulled over on a rough road, my co-     driver did not awaken, as any driver will tell you they will when the truck stops 2) I remember clearly the stop was 20 to 30 minutes, yet, I lost very little time in the log book, I even had time to get back in the truck to recover my spare roll of film!  The objects were clearly round, but not bright like a star or a light would be, more like a glow in the dark decal would be, except not green, but a orange colour. if they were 25 feet wide, I would put them at 1600 to 1800 meters away. I will give a more full report when I find my notebook, and possibly rescan the negatives, when I get my scanner installed. Maybe Walmart just hosed up the prints. I can only hope."}

This sighting was not an airplane, a toy, etc.  I still remember well to this day close to 40 years later.Therefore I know that I have seen a valid UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I was staying overnight at my cousins house in Waukegan Ill. I heard the humming and went to the window when I saw 2-3 circular discs hovering outside my cousins window, I ducked down then peeped up over the window sill and within seconds they left. I never told anyone cause I thought they would think its teenage imagination or anxiety irationaly behavior.But I know what I saw and I&apos;ve kept that buried with me for 40 yrs. To this day I know what I saw was real and haven&apos;t told anyone. I believe space continues and I was not afraid.

{"sighted_at": "20090503", "reported_at": "20090603", "location": " Madras, OR", "shape": " flash", "duration": "30 sec +\-", "description": "Blue flashing light (Basket ball) sized.  Fast Mover.I was traveling north on hwy 97 approximately 5-6 mile north of Madras, Oregon 4:30 AM.  In the distance I could see a blue flashing light in the road ahead.  It appeared to be about a half a mile (I guess) ahead of me and not moving.  The weather was high overcast and dry.  My first reaction was, it was a police car.  I began to slow down and as I approached, the light began to move away from me at a speed about double of my speed.  I was moving about 65 mph.  It was moving so fast I was trying to figure out how it could be a car.  The light still flashing at the same rate turned +/- 90 degrees and moved west into a very large irrigated field.  My guess it was 5 -10 feet off the ground and did not move up or down.  It looked to be about the size of a basketball.  Again it was dark and I did not have any references to compare it to.  It traveled out what appeared to be about a 1/8 - 1/4 mile and turned south now going the opposite direction I was moving.  I followed it visually the best I could.  After it passed my sideways field of view I began to watch it in my mirror.  It went past me a little further (hard to tell how far in the dark and I was still moving fairly fast).  It looked like it turned 90 degrees again and came back to the road.  The light looked as thought it came up behind me and I lost sight of it.  I did not see any residual light flashing around my vehicle.  Again it happened very fast (30 seconds +/-) and I was watching the road at the same time this was all going on.  I was driving a 2005 Ford pickup.  The exterior mirrors are large and it also has an interior mirror."}

{"sighted_at": "19730522", "reported_at": "20100731", "location": " Atlantic Ocean (USCG Cutter "Spencer"),", "shape": "", "duration": "", "description": "UFO sighting aboard Coast Guard Cutter SpencerAs per your phone call earlier today, I will restate what we experienced while aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Spencer WHEC-36, (commissioned in 1936 and decommissioned in 1974.  There is a new Spencer in service, but this is not the one I was aboard.  My ship was a 327 ft Cutter.  It can be viewed if you google Coast Guard Cutter Spencer WHEC-36.  I have tried to the best of my ability to recall the date, but since we stood so many Ocean Stations, it is hard to remember which of those this occured.  The conditions were warm, seas calm, and sighting occured during the night.  There were 140 mean aboard the Spencer, and a large number of my fellow crewmen witnessed what I did.  Officers and enlisted men saw what I saw.  I remember a ((specialty deleted)) had some state-of-the-art photo equipment.  I think he had an Olympus camera with telephoto lens.  He was at least one crewmen photographing this UFO.  We were in the middile of the Atlantic, all running ligh! ts on as usual.  I remember someone saying come on deck, there&apos;s a UFO.  The UFO had bright lights that changed color.  It was if the UFO was checking us out.  A ship with all its running lights on would be easily seen from above in the Atantic.  I was ((specialty deleted)).  Some names I remember were fellow ((specialties deleted)).  ((name #1 deleted)), ((name #2 deleted)) and ((name #3 deleted)).  I can&apos;t be sure they were aboard for this Duty, but I&apos;m sure at least one was.  I can not remember the others.  The UFO would come down hovering above us.  We could see what I would describe as portholes.  I rotated as it hovered.  The lights changed color.  Then it would go up in a second becoming very small.  Then it seemed to show off, as if it knew we were watching it.  It would accelerate across the sky in a split second while doing right angles.  Many photos of this craft were taken with telephoto lens.  I remember I couldn&apos;t wait to see the photos after they were developed.  I never saw them.  The show lasted about an hour.  Messages of this sighting were sent to Washington, DC.!  When we were relieved from Ocean Station Duty, we headed back to Governor&apos;s Island, Yankee Pier, where was our home port.  We were not expecting the reception that we received.  As we were docking, I saw quite a few &quot;Men In Black&quot; waiting to board our ship.  Usually after docking, if you did not have duty, we were granted liberty of usually 72 hours.  No one was allowed to leave the ship.  We were all interrogated one by one by these &quot;Men In Black&quot;.  We were told to sign an affidavit, stating we saw nothing.  We were warned that if we mention this to anyone, we would be gone.  We were told not to go to any news media, and try and tell this story.  If we did, we would be prosecuted by the govenment.  I found out later that my friend, the ((specialty deleted)) had all of his photo equipment, pictures, and developing equipment confiscated.  He was not reimbursed for any of his expensive equipment, it was simply taken from him.  I will end the story here, to be brief as possible.  Please give me a call at ((number deleted)) my home phone after recieving this, so I know you received it.  Please keep this confidential as possible.  I&apos;m sure you will.  I will research the Internent and my old photos, to see if I can get some crewmember names.Thank you,((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in the early 1970&apos;s is approximate.  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally good observer, and reporter of fact.
