Used this link to retrieve airports: https://datahub.io/core/airport-codes
This is the same as the airports GitHub provided in assignment description.

There are many different types of airports, but the ones of interest to us are large, medium, and small airports. 

The notebook file 'Add airport features.ipynb' will add the closest (large/medium/small) airport's name and distance to each row. The reference with the new features will be written to reference_w_airports.csv
